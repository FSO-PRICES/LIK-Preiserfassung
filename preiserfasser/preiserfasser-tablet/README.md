Things I did when setting up the project:

* `cordova platform add android`

For crosswalk (browser bundled with app)
* `ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview`
* `ionic state save`

For landscape:
* `ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-screen-orientation`
* `ionic state save`

For color / hiding of status bar:
* no need to do anything, already installed with ionic
